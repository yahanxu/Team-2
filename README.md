**Project description:**

Accurately forecasting future prices is extremely valuable given the volatile nature of US natural gas market and the sheer amount of factors that lead to its price formation. Therefore, this project aims to predict the future price of the most commonly quoted price for natural gas, the Louisiana-based Henry Hub price, which is futures-traded on NYMEX.
We will mainly use Bloomberg and the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) as data providers. This includes historical prices, natural gas storage levels, supply and demand dynamics, etc. This data is mainly quoted day-to-day and covers a period from the early 2000s to late 2022. We will predict the Henry Hub spot price using its past data and a wide range of features. We intend to use different machine learning algorithms to analyze these features and identify patterns and trends that indicate future price movements.
